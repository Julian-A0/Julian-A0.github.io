## Introduction

* This project inteneds to support the [JECK](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-208.github.io/ASU-EGR-304-Team-208/) Water Detection System. By measuring the pressure of the water flowing through a pipe we can determine if there is a leak present. A sudden drop in pressure in conjunction with the presence of water can tell us that a pipe may have burst, or if pressure drops in a manner unlike turning a handle off we can determine the possibility of a leak as well. 

### Project Summary

* The system utilizes a pressure sensor whose signal is amplified for readability. This input feeds into a Curiosity Nano Board microcontroller programmed with code to calculate the risk of a leak. Whether water presence is detected but pressure is not, or if pressure drops suddenly the program will digitally output an alarm signal. 


### My Contribution

* To support this project I have determined the most feasible pressure sensor to incoorporate in our design, and also drafted a readable schematic to display how the Curiosity Nano communicates with other subsystems.
