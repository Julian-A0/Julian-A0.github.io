PCB Design and Overview

## Overview

The PCB drafted from the schematic is set to a thickness of 0.5 ft/oz^2 using copper and consists of a front and bottom layer. This Design will be sent out to an external company for design and utilizes smaller trace widths for a clean, functional design. The low current draw allows for traces down to 11.7 mils when using a maximum of 0.3 A of current at the previously specified thickness. Two surface mount components are employed with the smaller dual voltage regulator sitting more isolated on the board to allow for easier soldering during assembly.
