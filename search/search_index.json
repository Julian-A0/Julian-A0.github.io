By measuring the pressure of the water flowing through a pipe we can determine if there is a leak present. A sudden drop in pressure in conjunction with the presence of water can tell us that a pipe may have burst, or if pressure drops in a manner unlike turning a handle off we can determine the possibility of a leak as well. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-summary","title":"Project Summary","text":"<ul> <li>The system utilizes a pressure sensor whose signal is amplified for readability. This input feeds into a Curiosity Nano Board microcontroller programmed with code to calculate the risk of a leak. Whether water presence is detected but pressure is not, or if pressure drops suddenly the program will digitally output an alarm signal. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>To support this project I have determined the most feasible pressure sensor to incoorporate in our design, and also drafted a readable schematic to display how the Curiosity Nano communicates with other subsystems. </li> </ul> <p>For all the sections</p>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>1) Input power is taken in through the 9V barrel jack.  2) 9V input is converted to 5V using an LM7805T regulator.    - This is done to appropriately power the Curiosity Nano board and water pressure sensor. 4) An analog pressure sensor is powered from this 5 V and take continous readings on the water pressure flowing the attached pipe. 5) The analog reading from the pressure sensor is fed into the Curiosity Nano's Analog to digital converter.  6) The program coded onto the Curiosity Nano will determine the appropriate \"bin\" to categorize the sensor reading based on predetermined pressure levels.    - These \"bins\" will categorize a safe or dangerous water pressure level. 7) Depending on the bin the system will digitally output 0 or 1 if the pressure is safe or dangerous.    - A high setting of 1 indicates an irregularity and will prompt the alarm to turn on. 8) This cycle repeats while plugged in. </p>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#pressure-sensor-block-diagram","title":"Pressure Sensor Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-selection-for-pressure-sensor-subsystem","title":"Component Selection for Pressure Sensor Subsystem","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#primary-components","title":"Primary Components","text":"<p>Table 1:  Pressure Sensor Selection</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1 -  Angst+Pfister Sensors and Power AG PEWA3403$49.00/eachlink to product * Robust industrial design* Handles a wide range of pressures* Offers pressure control features * Relatively expensive* Overbuilt for simple pressure monitoring.   Option 2 -  * DFRobot Gravity Analog Water Pressure Sensor * $17.50/each * Link to product * Cost effective * Handles a greater range of pressure than competitors at the price point  * Stable output voltage across pressure range * Datasheet lacks some depth on sensor construction * Requires additional thread on main pipe to take measurement <p>Choice: Option 2 - DFRobot Gravity Analog Water Pressure Sensor</p> <p>Rationale: This sensor leaves greater room in the budget while providing readings for a wider range of pressure. The output voltage works well with easily accesible voltage regulators and there are additional resources on the application of the sensor using other controllers. Given the compatability with similar sized controllers the lack of depth with dimensions can be navigable. This sensor advertises no corrosion and offers clear information on the thread size in the datasheet. </p> <p>Table 2:  Op-Amp Selection</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1 -  MCP6001T-I/OT $0.30/eachlink to product * Low Cost * Offers the exact number of amplifiers needed * Easy to read and highly detailed datasheets * Offers less flexibility and room for error than the 6004* Pin legs appear to require soldering   Option 2 -  * MCP6004-I/P * $0.59/each * Link to product * Cost effective * Offers additional non-inverting opamps  * Designer familiarity with the specific model * Slightly larger model than the 6001 * Has a more complex pin layout than the 6001 <p>Choice: Option 2 - MCP6004-I/P</p> <p>Rationale: There are many of these amps readily available given the materials supplied by the instructors. By having several amplifiers on this componenet there is also increased flexibility in how the circuit can be formatted. In the case of a pin failure the other non-inverting amplifier can be used instead. The cost is also negligble in choosing the 6004 over 6001. Size will not be of concern given the overall space allotted for the PCB. Table 1:  Pressure Sensor Selection</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1 -  LM7805T 5V 1.5A Voltage Regulator $0.33/eachlink to product * Easily obtainable * Extensive information available on design and implementation * Short circuit protections * Limited applications based on current rating * 4% accuracy (More accurate regulators exist)   Option 2 -  * L7805ACD2T-TR * $0.89/two-pack * Link to product * Cost effective in a 2-pack * Lower quiescent current than the LM7805  * Thermal Overload Protection * Surface mount mounting type * 10 V minimum input <p>Choice: Option 2 - LM7805T</p> <p>Rationale: The ease of use, accesss to this specifc voltage regulator and plentiful information troubleshooting and application make the LM7805T a reasonable choice for this subsystem. The minimum input voltage for this regulator is 5 V, which given the barrel jack swich that will be used works perfectly. The L7805ACD2T-TR has a minimum input voltage of 10 V which is too high for the jack. </p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
